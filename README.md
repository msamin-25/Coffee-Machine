# Coffee Machine Project

A Python-based coffee machine project that simulates a real-world coffee vending experience. This program can be implemented on a machine, allowing users to select coffee flavours, view costs and ingredients, follow payment instructions, and receive changeâ€”all through a simple, interactive interface.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily select coffee flavours and options with just a few clicks.
- **Payment Guidance:** Step-by-step directions on how to pay for your coffee.
- **Cost Display:** See the cost of your selected coffee before making a purchase.
- **Ingredient Information:** View the ingredients used for each coffee flavour.
- **Putting coin:** Put coins such as a quarter, dime, nickel or penny. 
- **Change Calculation:** Automatically calculates and returns the correct change.
- **Multiple Flavours:** Choose from a variety of coffee options.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Program:** Launch the Python script on your machine.
2. **Select a Coffee Flavour:** Choose from the available coffee options: Cappuccino, latte, espresso. 
3. **View Details:** The program will display the cost and ingredient list for the selected flavour.
4. **Payment:** Follow the on-screen instructions to make your payment.
5. **Dispense & Change:** The machine dispenses your coffee and returns change if necessary.

## Requirements
