# Coffee Machine Project

** This project is on the process, and will add more features.
 
A Python-based coffee machine project that simulates a real-world coffee vending experience. This program can be implemented on a machine, allowing users to select coffee flavours, view costs and ingredients, follow payment instructions, and receive change—all through a simple, interactive interface.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Program:** Launch the Python script on your machine.
2. **Select a Coffee Flavour:** Choose from the available coffee options: Cappuccino, latte, espresso. 
3. **View Details:** The program will display the cost and ingredient list for the selected flavour.
4. **Payment:** Follow the on-screen instructions to make your payment.
5. **Dispense & Change:** The machine dispenses your coffee and returns change if necessary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msamin-25/coffee-machine.git
   cd coffee-machine
   ```
